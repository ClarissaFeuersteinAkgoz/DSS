CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99
----------------------

NEW FEATURES

  o Initial release.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99-1
----------------------
  o Fixed a bug in newSeqCountSet in dealing with the input experimental designs.
  o Fixed a bug in computing local FDR. 
  o Add options to model the relationship between dispersion and mean expression.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0-1
----------------------
  o Fixed a bug in computing local FDR. 
  o Change the way to deal with genes with all 0 counts. Now the FDRs for these genes 
    are assigned as 0. 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.0
----------------------
  o Implemented methods for detecting differentially methylated loci (DML). 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.0
----------------------
  o Added functionalities for multiple factor experimental design. 
    Currently edgeR functions are used for glm fitting and hypothesis testing.
    DSS only provide functions for dispersion estimation.

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.5.0
----------------------
  o Implemented methods for detecting differentially methylated regions (DMR).

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.6.0
----------------------
  o Modified the algorithm for computing variances with smoothing. 

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.8.0
----------------------
  o Add function to detect DML for general experimental design.
