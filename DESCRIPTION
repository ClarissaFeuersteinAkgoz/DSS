Description: DSS is an R library performing the differential expression analysis for
  RNA-seq count data. DSS implements a new dispersion shrinkage method to estimate the
  gene-specific biological variance. Extensive simulation results
  showed that DSS performs favorabily compared to DESeq and edgeR when
  the variation of biological variances is large.
